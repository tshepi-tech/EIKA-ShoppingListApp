 ## Introduction ##
The following app is developed as a small coding assignment in the pre-course with Novare Potential.  The project was presented as a mock follow up to an interview with a large furniture shop. You can find the project description [here](https://www.icloud.com/pages/0kLMjMDP0qkWDEcFzbZE3DhuQ#project-0-shopping-list)

**TL:DR**

Develop a shopping list app that can work from any mobile web browser without installing anything from the app store. Minimum features the web application needs:
### Functional requirements: ###

* Develop it with React functional components instead of class based components. (Modern React)
* Allow to write a task by adding an item name and price. Example: “VÖXLOV”, “755:-”
* Allow to mark  a shopping item as completed/acquired.
* Allow to view or hide completed/acquired shopping items.
* We would like that the users can close and reopen the page without losing their list.

## App description ##

EIKA traditional pen and paper are offered in stores that customers use to jot down their shopping list. They would like to replace this with a digital version of a shopping list. 

### Use case: ###

A customer of EIKA that is looking for furniture and creating a shopping list while at home. They would like to buy several items but are considering many options and so may need to revise the list several times or shop over a period of time and so they need to track what has been bought and what hasn’t.
